To avoid username and password everytime we try to push
We need to add the SSH key in out github

To get the SSH key, we use terminal 'ssh-keygen'
then the Public and Private Key is generated

Save that SSH Public Key in the Github

Then change the remote origin path of the Repository if already added
Example -> git remote set-url origin git+ssh://git@github.com/jesh-exe/repositoryname
